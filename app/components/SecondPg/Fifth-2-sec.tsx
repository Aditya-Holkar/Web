              This project called for a deeply collaborative process—one that
              demanded a unique agency-client partnership. We quickly embedded
              the Patagonia design team into our San Diego HQ and worked in
              tandem from concept to completion. This set the foundation for a
              longstanding, successful relationship that extends beyond the
              traditional boundaries of agency-client servicing.

              Our team spearheaded the broader user experience while closely
              consulting with the in-house team at Patagonia on art direction,
              design systems, user testing and scripting. As the project
              progressed, we were given an additional opportunity to own the
              visual and strategic redesign of Patagonia’s brand initiative, The
              Footprint Chronicles. In doing so, we achieved a simple, cohesive
              design system that complemented the larger site.
